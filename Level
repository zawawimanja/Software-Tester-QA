1. Functional Testing - testing ensures that functions and features of the application work properly
-black-box testing that is based on the specifications of the software that is to be tested. The application is tested by providing input 
- providing input and then the results are examined that need to conform to the functionality it was intended for

Unit Testing 
Developer conduct testing

Integration Testing
Integration testing is defined as the testing of combined parts of an application to determine if they function correctly. Integration testing can be done in two ways: Bottom-up integration testing and Top-down integration testing.

System Testing
tests the system as a whole.

Regression Testing
 is performed to verify that a fixed bug hasn't resulted in another functionality or business rule violation.
 
 Acceptance Testing
 application meets the intended specifications and satisfies the clientâ€™s requirement.
 
 Alpha Testing
 Unit testing, integration testing and system testing
 
 Beta Testing
 
SIT test for tester

UAT test for end user
 
 
2.  Non-Functional Testing - testing examines other aspects of how well the application works.
 - test a software from the requirements which are nonfunctional in nature
 a) performance
 -any bottlenecks or performance issues rather than finding bugs in a software
 
 
i) Load testing  
- large data  how a system behaves under an expected load.
 ii)  Stress testing
 -   expected maximum.Running different processes that consume resources such as CPU, memory, server, et
 security, user interface, etc.
  
b) Usability Testing
 - ensures a good and user-friendly GUI that can be easily handled
  
c) Security Testing
- testing a software in order to identify any flaws and gaps from security and vulnerability point of view.
 
 Portability Testing
 - ensure its reusability and that it can be moved from another software as well
